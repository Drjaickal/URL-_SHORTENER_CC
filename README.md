**Simple URL Shortener**

This Python script provides a basic tool to shorten URLs using the TinyURL API.

**Features:**

- Shortens any valid URL.
- Uses the TinyURL service by default.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3
- `pyshorteners` library (`pip install pyshorteners`)

**Usage:**

1. Install `pyshorteners`:

   ```bash
   pip install pyshorteners
   ```

2. Save the script as `shortener.py` (or any preferred name).

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python shortener.py
   ```

4. Enter the URL you want to shorten when prompted.
5. The script will print the shortened URL.

**Example:**

```
Enter the URL to shorten: https://www.example.com/long/url/path
Shortened URL: https://tinyurl.com/yourshortenedcode
```

**Limitations:**

- Relies on the TinyURL service (free tier has limitations).
